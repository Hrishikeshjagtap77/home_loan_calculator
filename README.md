Home Loan Calculator


This project is a Home Loan Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users calculate their mortgage payments, the total interest paid over the life of the loan, and visualize how extra payments can help pay off the loan faster.

Features
Loan Calculation: Enter the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term to calculate the monthly mortgage payment.
Interest Calculation: Shows the total interest paid over the loan's term.
Extra Payment Simulation: Input extra payments to see how they shorten the loan term and reduce the total interest paid.
Interactive Results: Instant updates to calculations as inputs are adjusted.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and layout of the page.
CSS: Styling and responsiveness for different screen sizes.
JavaScript: Logic for mortgage calculations and dynamic updates.
How to Use
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter the following information:
Loan Amount: The total amount borrowed for the mortgage.
Annual Interest Rate: The interest rate applied to the loan.
Loan Term: The duration of the loan in years.
Extra Payments: Optional monthly extra payments to reduce the loan principal faster.
Click on the Calculate button to see the results:
Monthly payment.
Total interest paid.
Loan term after extra payments.

Example
For a loan of $250,000 at a 5% interest rate for 30 years, the calculator will show the monthly payment, total interest, and how much earlier the loan can be paid off with extra monthly payments.
